# Introduction to the dityverse

In this repo, you will find all you need to reproduce the slides of my introduction to the tidyverse. 
Just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley:

Alternatively, I also provide the pdf (which I built using the awesome `xaringan::decktape()` function).

This is work in progress. I need to:

* pick a language, French or English

* find an example in ecology to be used throughout the presentation

* use a [better presentation]( https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/2018/08/16/decouple-code-and-output-in-xaringan-slides/ ) of code and plots
