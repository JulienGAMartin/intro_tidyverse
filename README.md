# Introduction to the tidyverse

In this repo, you will find all you need to reproduce the slides of my introduction to the tidyverse. 
Clone or download the repo, then just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley:

Alternatively, I also provide the html and [the pdf](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/intro_tidyverse/blob/master/tidyogv2.pdf) (which I built using the awesome `xaringan::decktape()` function).

The first version of the slides was released on Jan 16, 2019 and was substantially updated on Jan 24, 2019.

When I find the time, I will: 

* Use a [better presentation]( https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/2018/08/16/decouple-code-and-output-in-xaringan-slides/ ) of code and plots

* Add more examples on stringr, regular expressions, tidyr (spread, gather), scoped verbs, forcats; maybe on purr

* Add examples of how to join tables, besides the video: use journal ranks given by Corey Bradshaw [here](https://conservationbytes.com/2014/08/01/a-fairer-way-to-rank-conservation-and-ecology-journals-in-2014/) and the data [there](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjabradshaw/JournalRanks/master/ecol.csv)

* ~~Pick a language, French or English~~

* ~~Find an example in ecology to be used throughout the presentation~~
