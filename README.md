# Introduction to the tidyverse

In this repo, you will find all you need to reproduce the slides of [my introduction to the tidyverse](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/intro_tidyverse/). 
Clone or download the repo, then just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley:

I released the first version of the slides on Jan 14, 2019 and I did substantial updates on Jan 24, 2019. I did another update on Oct 22, 2020.

When I find the time, I'd like to: 

* Use a [better presentation]( https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/2018/08/16/decouple-code-and-output-in-xaringan-slides/ ) of code and plots

* Add more examples on stringr, regular expressions, ~~tidyr (spread, gather)~~, scoped verbs, forcats; maybe on purr

* Add examples of how to join tables, besides the video: use journal ranks given by Corey Bradshaw [here](https://conservationbytes.com/2014/08/01/a-fairer-way-to-rank-conservation-and-ecology-journals-in-2014/) and the data [there](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjabradshaw/JournalRanks/master/ecol.csv)

* ~~Pick a language, French or English~~

* ~~Find an example in ecology to be used throughout the presentation~~
